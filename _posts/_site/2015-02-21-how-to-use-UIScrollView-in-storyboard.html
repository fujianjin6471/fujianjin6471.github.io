<p>Let’s make it from scratch. Choose a <strong>Single View Application</strong> template, name it anything as you like, in my case, <strong>UIScrollViewInStoryboard</strong> is used.</p>

<p>Drag a <strong>Scroll View</strong> on top of View Controller's default <strong>View</strong>.</p>

<p>Set constraints for <strong>Scroll View</strong> using the second icon at bottom right corner (assuming AutoLayout is allowed) as below:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/ConstraintsForScrollView.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As you see, <strong>Scroll View</strong> is the same size as <strong>View</strong>. Shouldn't <strong>Scroll View</strong> be bigger than <strong>View</strong>? In fact, the size of <strong>Scroll View</strong> and the size of its content are two different concepts. You can view <strong>Scroll View</strong> as a window, the scope you can see through it is often greater than itself. More on this later.</p>

<p>Drag a View on top of <strong>Scroll View</strong>. I prefer to rename it <strong>contentView</strong>, the name just suggests its usage. </p>

<p>Next step is to set constraints for <strong>contentView</strong>. But this time, it’s not that straightforward. </p>

<p>Firstly, add four constraints as we do for <strong>Scroll View</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/ConstraintsForContentView.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>What happened? Xcode gave us two warnings. </p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/WarningsAfterFourContentConstraints.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I think information lies in <strong>Document Outline</strong> gives better prompts than in <strong>Navigator</strong>, so let’s go there to have a look.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/WarningsInDocumentOutline.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The four constraints we added for <strong>contentView</strong> just means <strong>contentView</strong> (the view we added manually) has the same size with <strong>Scroll View</strong>'s contentSize (a property of UIScrollView defined in UIKit). Actually we haven't specified <strong>Scroll View</strong>'s contentSize yet, this is the reason why the first two warnings came out. The default size of contentSize is CGSizeZero, this explains the third warnings in <strong>Document Outline</strong>. </p>

<p>In order to fix the problem, we should add more constraints to make the scrollable content width and height clear. One way is to specify the <strong>contentView</strong>'s width and height. </p>

<p>Assume that I want to scroll horizontally and the content is three times of the screen. So the <strong>contentView</strong> should be equal height to screen and three times width of screen.</p>

<p><strong>Ctrl-drag</strong> from <strong>contentView</strong> to <strong>Scroll View</strong> in <strong>Document Outline</strong> and choose <strong>Equal Heights</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/EqualHeights.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Next, <strong>Equal Widths</strong>. </p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/EqualWidths.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>We will set <strong>contentView</strong>'s width three times of the screen, but not now.</p>

<p>Now let's decorate <strong>contentView</strong> with some images for final effect. Drag three <strong>Image View</strong>s onto the contentView and set constraints for them in turn.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/ThreeImages.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Set constraints for them. Take the leftmost <strong>Image View</strong> for example.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/Leftmost3Edges.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Then <strong>ctrl-drag</strong> from <strong>First</strong> (Image View) to <strong>contentView</strong> in <strong>Document Outline</strong> and choose <strong>Equal Widths</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/LeftmostWidth.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>But this time, equal isn't what we really want. Let's open <strong>Size inspector</strong> of <strong>First</strong> (Image View) and double-click <strong>Equal Width</strong> constraint. </p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/DoubleClickEqualWidth.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/AfterDoubleClick.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Adjust it like below:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/AfterAdjustment.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The rule underneath the hood is:</p>

<p><em>attribute1 == multiplier × attribute2 + constant</em> (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSLayoutConstraint_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010628">NSLayoutConstraint Class Reference</a>)</p>

<p>So what we set means the first <strong>Image View's width</strong> equals one third of <strong>contentView's width</strong>. Then do the same for the next two <strong>Image View</strong>s.</p>

<p>One last step, set <strong>contentView</strong>'s width to be three times of its superview (<strong>Scroll View</strong>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-2-21/ThreeTimesWidth.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>You can only one image now, that is the reason why we put the step as the last one.</p>

<p>Now run the program, the effect is just what you want.</p>
