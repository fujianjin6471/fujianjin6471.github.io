<p>Say you are using a <strong>UITextField</strong>, you want to tap another place to hide the keyboard. This article provides two methods to implement the simple functionality.</p>

<p>First, let’s realize it mainly through IB:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-4-4/DragATapGestureRecognizer.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-4-4/CtrlDragRecognizer.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Make it an action, add only one line of code as follow:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-4-4/OnlyOneLine.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>All done, so easy, right?</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-4-4/EffectOne.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Then, let’s realize it through pure code:</p>

<p>You just need to add two piece of code:</p>

<p>Add <img src="/images/2015-4-4/CreateGestureRecognizer.png" alt="image" /> in <em>viewDidLoad:</em> </p>

<p>and add a method <img src="/images/2015-4-4/HideKeyboard.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The effect is exactly the same as before. While there are of course other ways to hide keyboard, but that’s not the point in this article.</p>

<p>IB or pure code, which one do you prefer?</p>
